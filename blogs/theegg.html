<h3>The egg.</h3>
<p>
I won’t be writing a review longer than the story itself.<br><br>

Sympathy: Every one on earth shares the same core: We are all humans. So instead of judging, we should put ourselves in the shoes of others. It’s true that some acts can’t be justified. But in most cases, when you see a person in an unfortunate situation, tell yourself that in a parallel universe you might just be in his or her place. Which leads to my second point.
<br><br>
Gratefulness: Are you satisfied with the initial conditions that were given to you. If your answer is no, then would you agree to be put in other starting conditions throught the history of human kind but following a uniform probability distribution? One should be grateful for everything he has, and know that in no way you deserve what you get, you may work for it as hard as you want, but know that you got lucky.
<br><br>
Life is short: I am stating the obvious, but we tend to forget it, I tend to think that I would be around forever and I have all my time to do everything I want. I do not. This precious ressource should be spent wisely with people we love, and doing the things that mater to us.
