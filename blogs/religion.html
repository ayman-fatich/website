<h3>Introducyion</h3>
<p>
During the past years I’ve been thinking about everything I’ve been tought, meaning of life, why do we exist, how did we come into existence, does any of this actually matter… Writing this is supposed to keep a written track of my thinking process and help me see more clearly the path my toughts took to become what they are, and spot any issue in my reasoning.
</p>
<h3>Origine</h3>
<p>
As far as science goes, humans are a product of evolution, life started on earth a long ago, long enough for it to perfect itself. Life is a result of presize conditions on earth. It exists as a result of a series of astronomical events (Steven hawking a brief history of time). All the way back to the big bang. Great! But what created the bigbang? in other words, how something was created from nothing?<br>
Let’s suppose that the universe has always existed, collapsed into the thing that gave the bigbang and it’s basically a periodic function of time. Then what’s beyond the boundaries of the universe? I can’t help but see here the intervention of a superpower that could put everything into place, so perfectly to create such a wonderful universe, a power that isn’t bound the the limitation of space and time, and superpower that we can not comprehend. I am aware that this is more of a matter of perseonal belief rather than scientific reasoning. It is the most supernatural, yet logical explanation I could think of or find. This supernatural power that was mentioned by several religions around the globe. Is it god? And if so, did he ever interact with humans?
