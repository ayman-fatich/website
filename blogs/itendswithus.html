<h3>Lessons I’ve learned from this book</h3> 
  <p>
  It’s not always as easy as “I’m hurt I would leave” in any situation either homelessness or romantic. We solely see and judge based on our outer perspective ignoring the full image.
  
  We should have sympathy for others, never brag or accuse. 
  
  One should be resilient and improve his life no matter how bad his previous experiences were.
  
  We should never loose sight of our limits in a relationship and know when to quite no matter the consequences.
  
  Never blame yourself for other’s mistakes
